Approach 1:
Using intersection observer.
Attach a ref to last item of list. 
Observe this node and when it intersects/become visible. Make a new API call.

Approach 2:
scrollY: This tells you how far down the page you've scrolled from the top. (height you have covered/scrolled so far)
innerHeight: This is the height of the visible part of the browser window (viewport).
document.body.scrollHeight: This is the total height of the entire document, including the part that you may need to scroll to see.

scrollY+innerHeight == document.body.scrollHeight -> Means you have reached end of page

Implementation:
Check simmer ui folder
